# Bitmap-Project

Welcome to The T-T-T Game! 

Please make sure to follow the instructions carefully.
Please read all the instructions first and then begin playing the game.
Detailed instructions with images and snippets of the code are in the report, and it is best to review the report and the following instructions before playing.

Set both the Unit Width and Unit Height in Pixels to 4. 
Set both the Display Width and Display Height to 256. 
Set the Base address for display as static data. 
Make sure to connect the Bitmap Display and the Keyboard & Display MMIO Simulator to MIPS.
Once you set both of these up, you can assemble and run the program.

Once the program has been assembled and the run program button is clicked, the gameboard will be drawn.
Please wait till the entire gameboard is drawn until you begin playing the game.
Make sure to turn the volume up when the program starts, as there is a unique sound effect when the shapes are drawn.

Once the game board is fully drawn, the first player can start by picking a box to draw their shape.
The boxes are labeled 1-9, horizontally. (1-3) first row, (4-6) second row, (7-9), third row.
Make sure to select the box number first.
Once the box number is selected, do not click enter or any other key as this will mess up the program.
Continue reading the instructions once the box number is selected.

Next, select one of the colors listed below by clicking the correct key on keyboard: 
- Red: r    
- Blue: b    
- Magenta: m    
- White: w 
- Yellow: y    
- Cyan: c    
- Green: g    
- Orange: o 
- Purple: u    
- Gray: i    
- Maroon: n

Once again continue reading the instructions once the color is selected and do not press enter or any other key until you read the next set of instructions.

Finnaly, select one of the shapes listed below: 
- Plus Sign: p    
- Minus Sign: s    
- Square Box: o    
- X-Shape: x 
- Smiley Face Shape: f

Once this is done, your selected shape will be drawn in your chosen color at your chosen box. 
Make sure to do the steps in that order, as the program will not work if it is not done in that order. 
Once the first player has finished their turn, the next can go, and the game can be played until the game ends. 
The program will not let the user know who won, but looking at the game-board, this can be figured out.

To exit the game, press the spacebar.
